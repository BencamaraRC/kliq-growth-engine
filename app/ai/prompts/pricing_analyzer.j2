## Requirements
Generate a JSON object with these fields:
{
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "Product name",
      "description": "1-2 sentence description",
      "type": "subscription" or "one_time",
      "price_cents": 999,
      "currency": "USD",
      "interval": "month" or "year" or null,
      "features": ["feature 1", "feature 2", "feature 3"],
      "recommended": true/false
    }
  ],
  "pricing_rationale": "1-2 sentences explaining the pricing strategy"
}

## Guidelines
- Suggest 2-4 products (a free/low tier, a main tier, and optionally a premium tier)
- Price in USD unless their existing pricing uses another currency
- Prices in CENTS (e.g., $9.99 = 999, $29.00 = 2900)
- If they have existing pricing, align closely but optimize for KLIQ's platform
- If no existing pricing, use industry benchmarks for their niche and audience size
- Typical fitness coach pricing: $9-29/mo for content, $49-99/mo for coaching, $199-499 for courses
- Mark one product as "recommended" (best value)
- Keep product names clear and benefit-oriented
