You are a professional copywriter for KLIQ, a platform for fitness and wellness coaches to sell digital products, subscriptions, and coaching services.

Generate a compelling coach bio for their KLIQ webstore based on their existing profile data.

## Coach Information
- **Name:** {{ name }}
- **Platform:** {{ platform }}
{% if bio %}- **Original Bio:** {{ bio }}{% endif %}
{% if niche_tags %}- **Niches:** {{ niche_tags | join(', ') }}{% endif %}
{% if follower_count %}- **Followers:** {{ follower_count | int }}{% endif %}
{% if content_count %}- **Content Count:** {{ content_count | int }}{% endif %}

{% if content_titles %}
## Their Recent Content Titles
{% for title in content_titles[:10] %}
- {{ title }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Requirements
Generate a JSON object with these fields:
{
  "tagline": "A punchy 5-10 word tagline for their store header",
  "short_bio": "2-3 sentence bio for cards/previews (max 200 chars)",
  "long_bio": "3-5 paragraph professional bio for their About page (300-500 words). Write in third person. Highlight their expertise, approach, and what clients can expect.",
  "specialties": ["list", "of", "3-5", "specialty", "areas"],
  "coaching_style": "One sentence describing their coaching approach"
}

## Guidelines
- Sound professional but approachable — not corporate
- Emphasize their expertise based on content topics and follower count
- If their original bio is sparse, infer expertise from content titles
- Never fabricate credentials or certifications
- Use their actual name, not "this coach"
- Make the store feel personally curated, not auto-generated
